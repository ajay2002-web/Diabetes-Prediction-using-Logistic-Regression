# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
## In this project, I have predicted diabetes disease using Logistic Regression model.Following are the librabries I have used ### pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn and sklearn

## Following are the steps I performed in this project
### I. Loading the dataset into jupyter notebook
### II. Perfoming Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to understand the data better
### III. Standardization of the data with StandardScaler to make the model more efficient
### IV. Splitting the data into training and testing set with train_test_split
### V. Training the model with Train Data and testing it with Test Data
### Vi. Checking the model accuracy with accuracy_score
