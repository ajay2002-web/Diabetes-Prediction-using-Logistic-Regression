# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression#
##In this project, I have predicted diabetes disease using Logistic Regression model.
Following are the librabries I have used##
###pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn and sklearn###

##Following are the steps I performed in this project##
###Loading the dataset into jupyter notebook###
###Perfoming Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to understand the data better###
###Standardization of the data with StandardScaler to make the model more efficient###
###Splitting the data into training and testing set with train_test_split###
###Training the model with Train Data and testing it with Test Data###
###Checking the model accuracy with accuracy_score###
